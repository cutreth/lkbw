Update presentation of images on posts to optionally include caption (image title)
Adjust header stream block with toggles for control over head type (reference CSS for options)
Adjust date stream block to be centered with control over formatting (header, body, etc.)
Clean up header and footer: comment out and remove cruft
Wire up menus (based on other children from root: blog feed, contact us, about us, subscribe)

Clean up templates by removing if statements in stream block; define explicit templates instead
Consider leveraging Google Embed Map API

Configure better static file system (collectstatic)
-https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/DjangoStaticFiles
Look into better system for environmental variables
https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/environment-variables-for-web-apps
Update core settings
-https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.2.2/advanced_topics/settings.html
Configure recurring tasks (publish posts, garbage cleanup, etc.)
-https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.2.2/reference/management_commands.html

Enable caching and searching
-https://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.2.2/advanced_topics/performance.html
Reconfigure tagging
-http://docs.wagtail.io/en/v2.2.2/reference/pages/model_recipes.html#tagging

Finish static migration
-Shorten directory name for template CSS
-Add "collectstatic" as a deployment step in PRD
-Update static mappings in PRD to just point to root directory
-Remove manual static entries for both mapping modules

Build out stream block for embedded mapping
Investigate combined block with multiple elements
Remove dev environment references to wagtailgeowidget and wagtailgmaps(models.py, dev. py), delete manually copied static files
Create new admin widget for mapping
Create new HTML tempate for mapping
-https://github.com/Frojd/wagtail-geo-widget [only reference this for use injecting widgets within streamfields]
-https://github.com/springload/wagtailgmaps [copy this functionality in total]
